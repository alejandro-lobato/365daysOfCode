# 365 Days of Code
An attempt to commit once every day.

## When did I goof?

- **Day 17** - Spent the day playing Smite. Goddamn Battle Pass level 56.
- **Day 18** - Heck, I didn't want to. Got out of work late and couldn't be bothered to turn on the PC.
- **Day 20** - Was tired. It's been a rough week trying to keep up.

## How did I expiate such wrongdoings?

- **Day 19** - Extra credit baby. Got an idea for a quick challenge: Created an HTML timer locally for a coworker whose every day motivation is reaching Friday.
- **Day 21** - More extra credit.
